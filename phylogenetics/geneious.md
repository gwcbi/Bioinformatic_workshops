# Preparing Sanger sequences for further analysis

When you do sanger sequencing, you use a primer at the beginning of a sequence and a primer at the end of a sequence. This results in two sequences, one that starts at the beginning of a gene and one that starts at the end of the gene. 

### Geneious

Geneious is a paid software that is probably the best there is for visualizing, formatting, making contigs etc. with DNA. Although it is paid, you can get a two week free trial, and the restricted version still lets you view DNA sequences. You can [download Geneious here](https://www.geneious.com/download/).

1) Once you download geneious, you can import the .scf files by either clicking file->import->from multiple files, or by dragging and dropping the files into the geneious window.<br/>

2) Select the forward and reverse sequences, click "Align/assemble", then select "De novo assemble". Use the default settings (unless you want something specific) then press OK.
