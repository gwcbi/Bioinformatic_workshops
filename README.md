# Bioinformatic Workshop 
## Wildlife and Safety Bioinformatic Workshop


## Tools
#### These will be the tools we will be using:

* [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch)
* [PHYLO "Interactive alignment game"](http://phylo.cs.mcgill.ca "Interactive alignment game")
* [Evolution tree game](http://tidal.northwestern.edu/blog/bat/#level1)
* Phylotastic if we can get the link to work
* [CIPRES](http://www.phylo.org)



## Imported Goods Scenario

You're a biologist with the FDA. A shipment of mangos from Spain was received in the Baltimore shipment yard. Upon inspection of one of the crates, you see a few mangos have small dots on them that could be insect eggs. Before allowing the mangos to pass through the border and go into supermarkets, you want to be sure that those black dots aren't harmful. You don't want to introduce an invasive species or toxic organism into the US that could affect the mangos grown in Florida or California. You take the mangos with the small black dots on them back to the lab, extract DNA from the black dots, and [sequence](https://github.com/gwcbi/Bioinformatic_workshops/blob/master/sample_1.fasta) the CO1 gene. There are now 50,000 mangos sitting in a warehouse. Depending on your results, it is up to you to decide if the mangos will be allowed into the country.

#### Goals: 
1. Understand the format of a fasta file
2. Uploading to BLAST and performing a search.
3. Understanding the BLAST results
4. Reading an NCBI accession
5. Determine the results





## Bio-terrorism Scenario 

Three letters are delivered to the Pentagon, White House, and Capital building. An assistant at each government building opens thier respective envelope to find a letter and white powdery substance inside it. As an FBI investigative agent, you are called in to investigate these suspecious letters and unknown white substance. Each building that received a letter is quarantined until the genetic results are obtained. Each unknown white substance was amplified with primers useful for identifying most plants, animals, and bacteria, and [sequences](https://github.com/gwcbi/Bioinformatic_workshops) were obtained. Upon receiving the results, you need to decide if a building can be released or if the building needs to remain under quarantine and the people inside need to receive medical attention.

1) Student downloads fasta file
2) Student blasts all fasta sequences, finds accession number based on information gained from above
3) Google scientific names
4) Decide which building needs to stay under quaratine

#### Goals: 
1. Perform multiple BLAST searches
2. 

Results: wheat flour, rice flour, Bacillus anthracis 16s partial sequence


Complicating the scenerio:

seeing if the strain contains both the POX1 and POX2 genes (meaning full virulence)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_anthracis

We can always expand on the third envelope and ask which lab did the anthrax come from?


## 3a. Smuggling Identification

An individual is walking through airport customs security and pulled aside for a suspicious item in their bag. As a U.S. Customs and Border Agriculture Specialist, you are called over to help with the inspection. A small, heavy engraved object is pulled out from within several pairs of socks. You are

## 3b. Rhino sanctuary poaching? Tree building with CIPRES or something to see if Rhino horn came from a zoo animal that was killed, a wildlife sanctuary, etc. 

You are working at US Customs as an agent in charge of monitoring invasive and endangered species that cross the border. You become suspicious when you find a crate packed full of oranges
