# GW CBI Workshops
Welcome to the George Washington Computational Biology Institute's bioinformatic workshops page. Select one or more of the following workshop modules and use the [workshop template](workshop_template.md) to set up a workshop. Workshop modules should take no more than 30 minutes to complete and include questions to make the attendee think about processes and a small amount of data.

#### Understanding DNA, alignments, and Phylogenies
* [Understanding Sequence Data and using BLAST](blast.md)
* [Create a multiple sequence alignment](align.md)
* [Estimate a phylogeny](phylogeny.md)
#### Metagenomics
* [QC of NGS reads](QC.md)
* [Cleaning NGS reads](cleanreads.md)
