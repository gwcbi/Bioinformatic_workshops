# Bioinformatic_workshops


## Tools
#### These will be the tools we will be using:

* [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch)
* [PHYLO "Interactive alignment game"](http://phylo.cs.mcgill.ca "Interactive alignment game")
* [Evolution tree game](http://tidal.northwestern.edu/blog/bat/#level1)
* Phylotastic if we can get the link to work

## Imported Goods Scenario

You're a biologist with the FDA. After recieving a shipment of mangos from baltimore shipment yard, you see a few of the mangos have small dots that could be insect eggs on them. Before allowing the mangos to go into supermarkets, you want to be sure that those black dots aren't harmful, such as introducing an invasive species or toxic organism. You take the mangos with the small black dots on them back to the lab, extract DNA from the black dots and sequence the CO1 gene. Now it is up to decide if you should allow the mangos into the country.

There are 50,000 mangos sitting in a warehouse, depending on your results you will need to decide if the mangos will be allowed into the Unites States supermarkets. Don't want to introduce an organism that could devastate or harm the mangos growing in the US. 

1. Give story about why they are getting unknown file.
2. Teach student how to read fasta file and student will download fasta file.
3. Student will upload or copy sequence into BLAST and perform search.
4. Teach student about % identity, e-value and such, as to why we're picking a certain match over others.
5. Teach how to read NCBI accession
6. Ask what a fruit fly is? Google what it is.





## Bio-terrorism Scenario 

Three letters are delivered to the Pentagon, White House, and Capital building. An assistant at each government building opens thier respective envelope to find a letter and white powdery substance inside it. As an FBI investigative agent, you are called in to investigate these suspecious letters and unknown white substance. Each building that received a letter is quarantined until the genetic results are obtained. Upon receiving the results, you need to decide if a building can be released or if the building needs to remain under quarantine and the people inside need to receive medical attention. 

1) Student downloads fasta file
2) Student blasts all fasta sequences, finds accession number based on information gained from above
3) Google scientific names
4) Decide which building needs to stay under quaratine


Results: Bacillus mycoides, Bacillus weihenstephanensis, Bacillus anthracis 16s partial sequence


Complicating the scenerio:
http://www.pnas.org/content/108/12/5027.full.pdf
seeing if the strain contains both the POX1 and POX2 genes (meaning full virulence)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_anthracis
We can always expand on the third envelope and ask which lab did the anthrax come from?


## 3a. Rhino horn smuggling identification (Blast)

## 3b. Rhino sanctuary poaching? Tree building with CIPRES or something to see if Rhino horn came from a zoo animal that was killed, a wildlife sanctuary, etc. 

You are working at US Customs as an agent in charge of monitoring invasive and endangered species that cross the border. You become suspicious when you find a crate packed full of oranges
