## 1. fruit fly egg identification on imported fruit (Blast)

You're a biologist with the FDA. After recieving a shipment of mangos from baltimore shipment yard, you see a few of the mangos have small dots that could be insect eggs on them. Before allowing the mangos to go into supermarkets, you want to be sure that those black dots aren't harmful, such as introducing an invasive species or toxic organism. You take the mangos with the small black dots on them back to the lab, extract DNA from the black dots and sequence the CO1 gene. Now it is up to decide if you should allow the mangos into the country.


1. Give story about why they are getting unknown file.
2. Teach student how to read fasta file and student will download fasta file.
3. Student will upload or copy sequence into BLAST and perform search.
4. Teach student about % identity, e-value and such, as to why we're picking a certain match over others.
5. Teach how to read NCBI accession
6. Ask what a fruit fly is? Google what it is.










## 2. Illegal import (castor beans)/Cannabis/something (Blast + scientific name + wikipedia?)

## 3a. Rhino horn smuggling identification (Blast)

## 3b. Rhino sanctuary poaching? Tree building with CIPRES or something to see if Rhino horn came from a zoo animal that was killed, a wildlife sanctuary, etc. 

You are working at US Customs as an agent in charge of monitoring invasive and endangered species. You become suspicious when you find a crate packed full of oranges but also containing what appears to be bone, or a bone-like object. In addition, you see that a few of the oranges have small dots, that could be insect eggs, on them. You bring the bone and samples of an orange with the dots back into the lab, extract DNA, and sequence the CO1 gene. Now its up to you to decide if you should (1) allow the bone-like object into the country and (2) allow the oranges into the US.
