# GW CBI Workshops
Welcome to the George Washington Computational Biology Institute's bioinformatic workshops page. Select one or more of the following workshop modules and use the [workshop template](workshop_template.md) to set up a workshop. Workshop modules should take no more than 30 minutes to complete and include questions to make the attendee think about processes and a small amount of data.
