# Guidelines for adding content to our workshops
Please help us add content to any of these topics that you have expertise or would like to get expertise in!

As a review, Workshops are composed of modules, exercises and demos.

## Workshops
Workshops are multi-hour presentations that guide students through the completion of various tasks related to a common theme/goal.

Examples: Data analysis for metagenomes, Introduction to retrotranscriptomics

## Modules
Modules contain insturctions relating to tasks or concepts. Tasks often involve using outside tools that the CBI does not maintain

Examples: Intro to RStudio, accessing Colonial One, data wrangling, what is transcriptomics?, 16S amplicon vs whole-shotgun sequencing

## Exercises
Exercisese are critical thinking tasks that ask students to solve problems. Exercises often require the synthesis of information learned from modules and demos

Examples: What kind of sushi are you eating? Here is the data; do a BLAST search, build a tree

## Demos
Demos detail the use of a tool from beginning to end. They usualy include input data and are designed to show how a tool can be used to accomplish a specific objective.

Examples: Analyzing gut microbiome metagenomic reads from an autism study using pathoscope
