# Guidelines for adding content to our workshops
Please help us add content to any of these topics that you have expertise or would like to get expertise in!

For modules that teach material that is not our own, include links to the documentation or to the tutorial from the software.

If you create a workshop from scratch, include "*This module contributed to CBI Workshops by Your Name*" at the bottom, so we can give credit to your hard work. 

As a review, Workshops are composed of modules, exercises and demos.

## Workshops
Workshops are multi-hour presentations that guide students through the completion of various tasks related to a common theme/goal.

Examples: Data analysis for metagenomes, Introduction to retrotranscriptomics

## Modules
Modules contain insturctions relating to tasks or concepts. Tasks often involve using outside tools that the CBI does not maintain

Examples: Intro to RStudio, accessing Colonial One, data wrangling, what is transcriptomics?, 16S amplicon vs whole-shotgun sequencing

## Exercises
Exercisese are critical thinking tasks that ask students to solve problems. Exercises often require the synthesis of information learned from modules and demos

Examples: What kind of sushi are you eating? Here is the data; do a BLAST search, build a tree

## Demos
Demos detail the use of a tool from beginning to end. They usualy include input data and are designed to show how a tool can be used to accomplish a specific objective.

Examples: Analyzing gut microbiome metagenomic reads from an autism study using pathoscope
